Release 1 - the supply chain - a backdoor with backdoors. 

In this release find a small sample of the 900GB of mere 'user accounts and basic contact 
information' recently liberated from Cellebrite.

The exploit techniques that Cellebrite employ are wrapped in various encryption schemes 
in an attempt to protect 'their' intellectual property.  The custom routines for 
decrypting this lame ass protection are included in this release along with an 
accompanying sample .eas (DLL designed to target devices and applications) and .epr 
(bootloaders, exploits and shellcode) files.

The more discerning eye will notice that some of the Apple exploits bear a remarkable 
resemblance to those available to any teenager interested in the jailbreaking scene; 
perhaps not all those tax dollars have been wasted, the Blackberry epr is still worth 
a look at.

The ripped, decrypted and fully functioning python script set to utilize the exploits 
is also included within.

Coming soon.....

Release 2 - watching the watchers - pivot to win.

In this release find a small sample of files retrieved via the weaponized Cellebrite 
update service deployed on MS Windows based devices and desktops (SYSTEM privs) within 
the customer infrastructure.

Analysis of the compression and obfuscation employed by Cellebrite on products supplied to 
British MOD juxtaposed with the protection free versions supplied to SOCOM and others is
also included within. 

@FBI Be careful in what you wish for.
